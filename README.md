This is my Todo application that uses HTML, JavaScript and SCSS.
If you want to test this simple program, you have to compile SCSS into CSS and link that CSS file to HTML , but if you do not have a SCSS compiler, you can use the [CSS file](https://github.com/parhamzare701/Todo-JS-HTML-SCSS-/blob/master/Desktop/Todo/style.css) in this project .
You can ask me questions about anything,
and don't forget to follow my [Github](https://github.com/parhamzare701)
